<p>This is the same data displayed as a Bubble Chart. Instead of a time series, I only used the data for 2018. The countries are ordered by debt increasingly from left to right. A giant bubble means a larger debt ratio. The bubble background is the flag of the corresponding country.</p>

#### Which Chart Type?
I experimented with a bar chart, line chart, and bubble chart for this assignment. Each has its unique strength and weaknesses.

The bar chart is best for comparing the number of different elements. In this case, the quantity of debt across other countries. The line chart shows trends most effectively, which is best for time series data. Like the Sparklines above, it shows each country's debt change over time. Finally, the Bubble chart gives a more direct visual presence of the quantity of each item and highlights the largest ones.

#### Why Bubble Chart?
I was trying out the different chart types on Flourish and thought it would be interesting to make a bubble chart that displays the debt ratio of each country as a bubble with the country flag as the background. I think it gives a more substantial visual impact on how large or small a country's debt ratio is compared to other countries. For example, in 2018, Greece and Japan had a significantly larger debt ratio. I also think adding country flags as the background of the bubbles helps people understand country codes better, as many people are unfamiliar with the three-letter country codes.
