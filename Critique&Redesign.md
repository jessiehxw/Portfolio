### Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

#### Why these charts need redesign?
As the semester proceeds, CMU students are experiencing an increasing amount of stress with a more significant workload and exams. Thus, I searched "College Student Stress Report" online and clicked on the first result that popped up. The report revealed different stress sources for students, including grades, bullying, homesickness, etc. It contains numerous visuals throughout the information. However, I found the visualizations poorly designed with a bad layout, wrong choice of color, and chart types. These flaws prevent them from adding value to the article, and I would love to see them delivered in a better form.

#### Critique on the Original Charts
There are multiple charts on this page. In the Google form, I critiqued on several of them with their positive and negative aspects. Since I don't have time to redesign every single one of them, I chose to focus on one pie chart, one bar chart, one donut chart and one special type.

#### Pie Chart:

Pros:
- clear chart titles that sum up the content
- show comparison between different categories

Cons:
- The sequential colors used for different categories are too similar
- Usually, deeper colors represent high density, but it is the opposite. The most significant stress is in the brightest blue. This can confuse people at first look
- The numbers are poorly positioned. For small slices, the number doesnâ€™t fit in the piece.
- The current title is a good summary but doesn't tell a good story. It can be changed to something more informative.
