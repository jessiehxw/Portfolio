### Why these charts need redesign?
As the semester proceeds, CMU students are experiencing an increasing amount of stress with a more significant workload and exams. Thus, I searched "College Student Stress Report" online and clicked on the first result that popped up. The report revealed different stress sources for students, including grades, bullying, homesickness, etc. It contains numerous visuals throughout the information. However, I found the visualizations poorly designed with a bad layout, wrong choice of color, and chart types. These flaws prevent them from adding value to the article, and I would love to see them delivered in a better form.  

Below is how I rate the visualizations on this site with the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile:

Overall, the charts on the site are functional as basic visualizations with accurate information and the necessary components. However, they are not appealing to readers and lack intriguing insights. Basically, not "interesting" enough to impress readers with the selected contents and persuade them with the given facts.

#### Critique on the Original Charts
There are multiple charts on this page. In the Google form, I critiqued on several of them with their positive and negative aspects. Since I don't have time to redesign every single one of them, I chose to focus on one pie chart and one donut chart.

#### Pie Chart:

Pros:
- clear chart titles that sum up the content
- show comparison between different categories

Cons:
- The sequential colors used for different categories are too similar
- Usually, deeper colors represent high density, but it is the opposite. The most significant stress is in the brightest blue. This can confuse people at first look
- The numbers are poorly positioned. For small slices, the number doesn’t fit in the piece.
- The current title is a good summary but doesn't tell a good story. It can be changed to something more informative.

#### Donut Chart:

Pros:
- Four donut charts show the proportion of each group side by side. Since they don't add up to 100%, donut charts are good choices for showing percentages.

Cons:
- The two zeros at the end of each percentage value are unnecessary.
- There is no emphasis on the chart with close percentages, single color, and small labels below each donut.
- As all the charts have the same color, there is no need to have a color legend below each one.
- According to the context (“These sounds include people talking in their native language (50%), local community hustle and bustle (26%), public transport sounds (25%), and native wildlife (20%).”), the “Native language conversations” and “native wildlife noises” are part of the “sounds of their hometown.” However, the chart compares them at the same level as separate categories, which is misleading.

### Sketch some ideas!
After evaluating the good and bad's of the two charts, I brainstormed ideas for improving each and sketched them in different layouts, chart types, and colors.

#### Pie Chart Remake:

Firstly, I rewrote the title and subtitle to be more informative
