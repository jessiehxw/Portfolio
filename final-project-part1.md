### Final Project - Part I

September 22nd 

#### Outline
In summary, I want to talk about people's happiness rate worldwide, how they changed over time, and what elements caused the changes. Recently, since graduation is close, many of my friends have been making a massive effort trying to find their first full-time job, and many have been complaining to me about how hard it is to find employment right now, both in the US and in China. Especially my peers at CMU, we are under the stress of completing the large workload at school and doing job searches simultaneously. When I chatted with my mom about the situation, she told me how life was more straightforward with less stress and more explicit goals in old times, although the living standard was much lower. Thus, I would like to dig into how contemporary people seem less satisfied with life even though we live on higher standards with better food, housing, transportation, and technologies.

**Setup:** The Happiness score in multiple countries, including the US, has been decreasing.

**Conflict:** Although people are improving material well-being, people are experiencing immense stress in their current fast-paced life.  

**Resolution:** Implement a positive living mindset and choose a lifestyle that suits you instead of blindly chasing people on the internet.
